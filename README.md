This repo contains supplemental results produced by the research team for our manuscript entitled, "Identifying protective factors related to burnout, moral injury, and resilience of registered nurses: An exploratory analysis."

Supplemental files
Grand means are reported for ANOVA results in the manuscript. Subsequent analyses were conducted to produce estimated marginal means plots and pairwise comparison tables, which are used for the interpretation of results. Those plots and means are found here, with each file name in this repo representing a bivariate analysis.

Abstract
Nursing leadership continue to grapple with the pre-existing social, physical, spiritual, and emotional toll experienced by the nursing workforce, further exacerbated by the pandemic. The three-fold purpose of this current quantitative study was to measure the impact of the pandemic on nurses’ levels of burnout, moral injury, and resilience; measure levels of compassion satisfaction, and secondary traumatic stress; and identify protective factors against burnout and moral injury that could bolster resilience. An electronic survey was created using three validated instruments and sent to nurses in one U.S. state. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Survey response rate was 5.5%. Respondents reported high levels of burnout and moral injury, and reduced levels of resilience. Protective factors included age, experience, education, and religion, with the older, more experienced, and educated nurse who identified as Christian being found to represent the most protected group.  Multi-pronged strategies are needed to support, sustain, and recover nurses’ mental health across demographics in order to meet current and future workforce needs.
